1) Many datasets with missing data, denoted as NaN. Those datasets are:

GestureMidAirD1
GestureMidAirD2

2) The names of "NonInvasiveFatalECGThorax1.tsv" and "NonInvasiveFatalECGThorax2.tsv" are wrong. They should be "NonInvasiveFetalECGThorax1.tsv" and "NonInvasiveFetalECGThorax2.tsv".

3) The class labels are inconsistancy. Some datasets with classes 0~N, yet others with classes 1~N. "DistalPhalanxTW" even starts from 3. Moreover, some datasets with classes -1 and 1.
